There are illogical moments but that don't take away you, because the Director keeps you invested in the 'state of disbelief' and that is the success of this movie. There is hardly any sugarcoating to the criminal angle of Rocky, and it is more of a man with a promise to fulfill. Kudos to the entire cast and crew for a honest 'masala movie'!!\n",

      "Prashast_Singh15 April 2022\n",
      "\"Hindi viewers, please don't regret later on when it'll be playing on TV and internet.\" This is what I mentioned in my review of KGF Chapter 1 after I watched it in cinemas. And today, as I witnessed the second chapter of this epic action saga in cinemas as well, I found myself blown away by the gripping plot, gorgeous visuals, stunning action sequences and most importantly, Yash's screen presence as Rocky. I can safely proceed to state that my expectations were not only met, but also surpassed by this fine sequel.\n",
      "\n",
      "KGF Chapter 2 expands the scale and story introduced to us in part 1 and ends up raising the bar higher. The makers were definitely quite confident making it, and it shows in every single frame. From beautifully picturizing the KGF (Kolar Gold Fields) to explosively choreographing the action sequences to elevating Rocky's character at multiple occasions, they have shown they knew what the viewers wanted, and delivered the promise product without any hassle. I was also glad to see heavy cheering and whistling throughout almost the entire duration, and some credit goes to the dialogue writer as well. The music was also good and delivered without interfering with the storytelling (though one song in the second half wasn't really necessary).\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest plus point of the film is its screenplay. From re-introducing our favorite characters and introducing new ones to building up conflicts and backing them with explosive action, KGF Chapter 2 has all the ingredients of a proper mass entertainer. Not a single scene where it feels dragged or overdone. Sure, it does feel long at times, but it never gets boring, and with several twists and turns, the story remains intriguing till the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I'd definitely want to tell the viewers is to not simply get up and walk away once the credits start rolling. There is a mid-credits scene, and it's an important one. Other than that, this film should be on your watchlist if you like period action films. In the end, I just feel glad and kind of proud seeing a film I liked in 2018 going on to receive much bigger hype and viewer turnout with its second part in 2022.\n",

      "An improvement over the original in the technical aspects, but not the writing! [+53%]\n",
      "arungeorge136 May 2022\n",
      "K. G. F: Chapter 2 is a film that purely runs on technical finesse. There are impressively staged set-pieces, sophisticated production design, a pan-Indian (and possibly international) plot setup, and thumping background score. But the writing, something that didn't work for me in Chapter 1, is still very superficial. In Chapter 2, Rocky (Yash, with commanding screen presence) is no longer an underdog. He has already achieved legendary levels of notoriety with his deeds, even attracting the attention of the nation's Prime Minister. Prashanth Neel is great at crafting mass moments one after the other, in quick succession. The film, as a whole, is a carefully designed collection of mass moments - with frequent interludes of mother-son sentiment and a drab romance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my review for Chapter 1, I'd hoped to see Srinidhi Shetty get at least a decent arc but alas, it's even worse than the first. Not only is she deemed mere entertainment for the protagonist, her only task in the film is to say the three magical words to the guy who's been holding her captive (Stockholm Syndrome max?). Okay, I get it. My bad to even think she'd have anything worthwhile to do in the film other than \"spoilers: die while pregnant\". The mother-son flashbacks are as weird as they can get - she whines and delivers a whole massy sermon to hospital personnel when her son is battling for life. I couldn't even buy the reason for Rocky's excessive greed - it's an attempt at painting him grey alright, but it's not written well. Neel shouldn't ever attempt family dramas or rom-coms. Like, ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanjay Dutt's Adheera has got the look for sure, but the nature of his character is so utterly generic that he fails to rise above Chapter 1's Garuda. Raveena Tandon's PM Ramika Sen should have been the film's trump card, but the whole angle around her is played in the safest possible manner, giving Rocky a few more instances of elevation. The mass film tropes are scattered all over the place. But if you need a filmmaker to inventively visualize your action, Neel is the man you should call. Maybe, he can make a full-blown actioner (where the core focus is just on the action) without the build-ups, the monologues, or the exaggerated sentiments. I'd definitely buy a ticket to that film!\n",

      "OMG. What did I just watch! KGF Chapter 2 is a blistering, adrenaline-pumping, high-stakes sequel to what was an era-defining part 1 that propelled not just Prashant Neel and superstar Yash but also the entire Kannada film industry, into national prominence. The team has clearly made the best use of the higher budget it received after the first film's success, keeping the emotional resonance from the original intact and building elaborate, well written and intelligently shot and edited mass elevation scenes that will keep you clamouring for more till the awe-inspiring climax.\n",
      "\n",
      "We rejoin our hero, Rocky Bhai as he takes over control of the Kolar Gold Fields after having killed the demonic \"Garuda\" in the first film, only to have an entire can of worms open up as a consequence with everyone ranging from Garuda's vengeful uncle \"Adheera\" (Sanjay Dutt) to the Prime Minister of India \"Ravika\" (Raveena Tandon) training their sights on his lucrative fiefdom. Director Prashant Neel gets his casting choices spot on with both these Bollywood biggies bringing in their A-game as menacing antagonists that hold their own against Yash's sheer swag and star power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The void left by legendary Kannada actor Anand Nat opting not to return to the franchise due to personal reasons was ably filled by National-award winner Prakash Raj, while the rest of the returning cast play their roles with flourish, especially Ayyappa P Sharma as \"Vanaram\", Harish Rai as \"Khasim\", Achyuth Kumar as \"Guru Pandian\" and Govinda Gowda as the cheeky \"office assistant\". Srinidhi Shetty is nondescript as Rocky Bhai's love interest \"Reena\", with their romance track bordering on an extreme case of Stockholm Syndrome, being the only hiccup in an otherwise flawless mass masala entertainer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prashant Neel's ability to smoothly intercut the main timeline with flashbacks to Rocky Bhai's childhood means that the mother character, played ably by Archana Jois, makes an even more emotionally endearing impact on Chapter 2, with the mother-son bond continuing to be the glue that holds together what would otherwise have been a shallow massy outing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prashant Neel has made creating innovative mass elevation sequences an art form and with a star of Yash's natural badassery and swagger as his foil, the auteur has clearly cut loose with the sheer scale and scope of his sets rising to earthshattering levels, without sacrificing on ingenuity and the ability to catch the audience by surprise. The intro sequences of our three primary characters, played by Yash, Dutt and Tandon are choreographed with pinpoint precision to evoke maximum mass impact and are custom-made to play to each performer's strengths. While Neel uses Dutt's eyes and hulky silhouette to portray his beastly and brutal nature, with Tandon, he resorts to using minimal hand and facial gestures to showcase the sheer unspoken power wielded by her character, inspired by India's Iron Lady, Indira Gandhi herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what can I say about Yash that hasn't been already said? Irrepressible swag, a natural coyness and obnoxious body language mean he is a natural fit as the morally ambiguous gangster and it is this very nature that adds to the unpredictability of the KGF universe with the audience constantly on the ropes, unable to guess or comprehend what the crazy mafioso will do next. Music director Ravi Basrur carries on the same rich vein as in the first part, elevating each punch sequence with layers of feeling and goosebumps, switching over effortlessly from the massy highs of \"Sulthana\" to the emotionally wrought \"Thannane\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"KGF Chapter 2\" stands head and shoulders over other recent Indian blockbuster fan service mass vehicles like \"Pushpa (2021)\" and \"RRR (2022)\" because of the editing and staging prowess of its director, with seemingly unrelenting action and a narrative that constantly keeps you guessing and on a knife-edge. A mandatory theatre watch! Highly, highly recommended! And don't forget to catch the post-credits scene!\n",

But when I compare to many other south action/drama flicks it is over the top in all areas. Acting is average, direction is avg, screenplay average and story is basically inspired by many other movies like Scarface, Agneepath etc etc. The only thing I liked about this movie is music and BGM. And for this only reason you can watch it in the cinema halls.\n",

      "The Most Anticipated Sequel after Bahubali delivers on a lot of fronts, but misses on a few too. The film starts right from where the first film ended, Rocky taking over KGF & all of his adversaries rushing in to claim their stakes. Instead of the relentless action in the first film, this time you get political & strategic plays, with both sides taking wins & losses. The dialogues are great once again, Performances from Yash, Sanjay Dutt & Raveena Tandon were superb. Great Cinematography & Music that evokes the emotions. The romantic angle is better in this one & the great emotional bond of Mother & Son is once again central to the plot. But there are big issues in screenplay & editing. Instead of the streamlined story of the first film, this one stretches in so many directions & it becomes really tough to keep up with it. A lot of scenes abruptly end & I expected the ending to be much more powerful. A great effort but ultimately falls short of expectations.\n",
